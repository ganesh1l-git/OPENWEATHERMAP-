DOMAIN:PYTHON
DURATION:DECEMBER TO JANUARY

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to:
Fetch data from a public API: Using Python, we will make an HTTP request to a public API like OpenWeatherMap to retrieve real-time data about the weather,
such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure for a specific location (e.g., a city).

Data Processing: The fetched data, usually in JSON format, will be processed to extract key information that is relevant for visualization.
This can include temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, air pressure, and other relevant weather metrics.

Data Visualization: Using visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, we will present the extracted data visually. For example, 
we could create bar plots, line charts, or scatter plots to show how temperature, humidity, and pressure vary over time or across different locations.

Key Steps:
API Interaction:

We will use Python's requests module to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data in a structured format.
The API response (usually in JSON) will include details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, which we will parse for visualization.
Visualization Creation:

The project might also allow us to explore trends, like how weather metrics fluctuate during the day or across different cities.
This could lead to the use of time-series visualizations, heatmaps, or scatter plots.

Example Outcome:
A bar plot that shows the temperature, humidity, and pressure for a city.
A line graph showing how temperature changes throughout the day or over several days.
Project Use Cases:
Weather Apps: This approach could be used in weather apps to present users with real-time, visual representations of the weather.
Data Analysis: It allows us to analyze how different weather metrics correlate with each other or vary across time and locations.
Learning Opportunity: The project provides hands-on experience with API requests, data manipulation, and visualizations, making it a great learning project for Python developers.

In summary, the project demonstrates how we can fetch weather data from a public API and turn that data into meaningful visual insights using Python.
